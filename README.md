========================

This is a collection of scripts and functions I use and reuse every time I want to load a bunch of data into a database.

Quickstart
----------

1. clone this repo (https://github.com/eyeseast/data-loading-kit)
2. restart git (`rm -rf .git && git init`)
3. edit `loaddb.py` as needed
